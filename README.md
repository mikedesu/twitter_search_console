```
Usage:

python3 console.py
```

Currently super-basic right now, but near-term upgrades:

- Flexibility on how many tweets appear per search
- Flexibility on how tweet text gets cut-off (currently at first newline to avoid one tweet taking up too much screen space)
- Flexibility on how tweets are displayed (currently using "rich" tables but am open to other presentation styles)
